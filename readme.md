![logo](/image.jpg?raw=true)

Utopia, a multiplayer incremental browser game made
as a final project in the subject DAT219 - Internet Services. Utopia is a game in which players
are to work together with a group, against several other groups, to gather resources without
depleting them and eventually be the last group standing. We were given a time limit of ten
weeks in which we were to plan and develop a website, where the focus would be on the back-
end part of it. The purpose of the project was to let us demonstrate our newfound competence
in creating a website using the server side web application framework ASP.NET. We were also
required to be in groups of four to six people. This was to give us the experience of working
in a team environment. The project period also crashed with the Coronavirus pandemic of
2020, so not only did we learn to work together as a team, but we also learned to work and
communicate remotely. Overall we are very pleased with how the final product turned out,
and it ended up meeting most of our expectations.
